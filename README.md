# PokeDex App

This application was created with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I created a simple yet informative site that would provide Pokemon lovers with the basic information needed for each Pokemon. I created this application during my intro to JavaScript course via the **Career Foundry Software Engineering** program. This app includes a list of all 150 pokemon and their attributes that have been loaded using _Ajax_.

## App Features

-The intial bones of the application were created with HTML and CSS, then as the site was built up, JavaScript was utlized more frequently. 
-JavaScript was used heavily as time went on as a form of practice, and in the final stages of building the app, Bootstrap was implemented for  clean styling.
-Data was loaded using Pokemon API and Ajax.
-App uses Fetch and Promise Polyfills.
-The user is able to view and click on the name of any given Pokemon and a modal with a picture, the name, and key attributes will pop up.

**This App depends on Bootstrap for layout and styling purposes, however without this programming it is fully functioning with solely _HTML, CSS, and JavaScript_.**

All credit for the **PokeAPI** goes to its creators and I am grateful for their work as it has made this project more streamlined and uniform.
